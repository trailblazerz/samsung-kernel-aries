Prerequistics
Basic knowledge of Linux and compiling is required to be able to build a kernel. We need a modern Linux box (preferably).

First we need to setup a directory in which we will clone the kernel and initramfs repository. 
In this guide we will setup them in /tmp but you can do it in any directory you want.

mkdir /tmp/semaphore
cd /tmp/semaphore

Clone the basic kernel repository
git clone https://github.com/stratosk/samsung-kernel-aries

Clone the initramfs repository
git clone https://github.com/stratosk/ics-ramdisk

OK, first step done. We got the code. Now we have to do some preparation and compile it.
I prefer to use a mini ugly script to compile the kernel and pack it.
It's located in the root of the kernel tree (/tmp/semaphore/samsung-kernel-aries/sbuild.sh)

Open this file with an editor of your choice (I prefer vi) and edit:
1) The two lines with the 'make' command changing the CROSS_COMPILE= option. You need to set the path from the cross compiler toolchain. 
I use the one that it's included in CM9 repository.
2) The line starting with the 'find' command changing the destination directory of the modules location. This is into the initramfs directory.
In our example it's /tmp/semaphore/ics-ramdisk/ics_combo/files/modules


Configure the kernel:
The Semaphore's kernel configuration is located in the file config_sema in the root kernel directory.
So, we need to copy this file as .config:

cp config_sema .config

Then we run this command to run Linux kernel configuration utility:
make CROSS_COMPILE=/kernels/semaphore_cap/android/android/system/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi- ARCH=arm menuconfig

Go to 'General Setup' and we change the Initramfs source files to /tmp/semaphore/ics-ramdisk/ics_combo/
We also need to change the next 2 options User ID and Group ID to whatever uid and gid we are logged in in the Linux box. In my case is 500,500.
We exit and save the configuration.


Now we are ready to build the kernel!

We just run:
./sbuild.sh

wait few minutes (time depends on the machine) and hopefully the compilation will end.

The script will produce 2 files.
1) /tmp/semaphore/samsung-kernel-aries/arch/arm/boot/zImage 
2) /tmp/semaphore/ics-ramdisk/cwm/Semaphore_ICS_1.2.0s.zip

These are the 2 known files that you can flash via Heimdal or CWM respectively
